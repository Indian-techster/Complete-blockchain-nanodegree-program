A hash is a digital fingerprint for information
Hashing function-Maps a group of data to a unique hash value




Data --->Hashing function-->Hash
           (SHA256)
           SHA is the hashing algorithm while 256 is the outcome

Block is a container that holds a list of transactions to be added to the blockchain
Shared digital ledger that records a list of transactions

Blockheader:
*Previous Block hash//It stores the value of the previous hash
*Time//Stores time 
*Merkle Root//Transactions in the forms of hashes are paired and they are again  merged till they get a single value
*Nonce
Block data+Nonce=Hash value

Blockchain 

It is a digital ledger that contains the entire history of transactions made on the network

Blockchain is a distributed network that allows information to be spread out across many users

Mempool
Waiting place for all unconfirmed Transactions before they are added to the blockchain

Consensus 
How the network reaches agreement about which transactions are most trustworthy.
Proof of work
Proof of stake 
DBFT
Pooled mining
A mining approach wherre multipleminers combine resources to mine a block and then 
split the block reward.
Proof of Stake 
It seeks to achieve consensus by giving votes to those with stake in the system.
